# Fully React Application

This project is part of the Openclassrooms [Web Developer training path](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/899-developpeur-web) :rocket:

The objective is to create an application using the React JS framework. No library should be used except [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

## :warning:Technical constraints :

### :computer:React :
It is imperative to use these React elements for quality code:

:white_check_mark: Modular and reusable component decomposition

:white_check_mark: One component per file

:white_check_mark: Logical structure of different files

:white_check_mark: Use of props between components

:white_check_mark: Use of state in components when necessary

:white_check_mark: Event handling

:white_check_mark: Lists: React allows for really interesting things with lists, iterating over them, for example with map. They should be used as much as possible.

It is also recommended, but not mandatory, to use functional components rather than class components.

### :page_with_curl:React Router :

Route parameters are managed by [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) in the URL to retrieve information about each accommodation.

:white_check_mark:There is one page per route.

:white_check_mark:The 404 page is returned for each non-existent route, or if a value present in the URL is not part of the provided data.

:white_check_mark:Router logic is consolidated in a single file.

### :page_with_curl:General :

:construction:The code should not produce any errors or warnings in the console.

The application must be responsive :triangular_ruler:
